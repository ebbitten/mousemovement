Trainign Notes

1.27.24
a. Tried adding 2 fully connected layers, was worried that'd cause overfitting so added a RELU. Also added a custom loss function to weight the endpoints more
b. tried starting with a and then more heavily weighting (5,5,1 instead of 2,2,1)
c. tried restarting from fresh with the more heavy weights

created a grid search to allow searching over different hyper parameters
updating the model to try averaging the current output method (1 LSTM->FFC->FCC->output) with just drawing a straight line

1.28.24
Adding a layer in the model that runs in parallel to the ltsm layer. This layer will just be a evenly spaced line between the start and end points.
Also manually setting the first and last cell in the lstm layer to be the first and last point. (removed this)

second round going to try removing hard coding the lstm output to start and end on the line
