Trainign Notes

1.27.24
a. Tried adding 2 fully connected layers, was worried that'd cause overfitting so added a RELU. Also added a custom loss function to weight the endpoints more
b. tried starting with a and then more heavily weighting (5,5,1 instead of 2,2,1)
c. tried restarting from fresh with the more heavy weights
